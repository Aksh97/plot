We will attempt multiple cluster threshold configurations for the best results.
Trying: mean/max distances with 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 standard deviation(s)...
Best Configuration: 
Threshold metric: mean
Number of standard deviations: 1.0
Test accuracy: 1.0
Test Precision: 1.0
Test Recall: 1.0
Test F-1 Score: 1.0
